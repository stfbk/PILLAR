In this tab, you should describe as clearly and precisely as possible the
application, by entering all the information in the slots below. Include
technical details and how the application works, as well as possible. In the
Data policy section, you should describe how personal data is handled by the
application, including how long it is retained. In the Database schema, you can
specify the data which is collected and used by the application, including if
it is encrypted at rest and whether it is considered sensitive. The more
details you include, the more accurate the subsequent analysis.
