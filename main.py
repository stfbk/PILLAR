    This function initializes the session state for the application. It creates
    the necessary session state variables and sets their initial values. To
    understand the structure of the session state, please refer to the comments
    in the code below. If the code uses a session state variable that is not
    initialized here, it probably means that the variable is associated with a
    specific streamlit element, with the "key" parameter. In that case, the
    variable is initialized when the element is created and always has the
    value of the element. Look for the element in the corresponding tab file to
    understand how the variable acts.
